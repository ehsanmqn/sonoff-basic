#### Sonoff Basic
The Sonoff Mini is, as the name implies, a very small device, designed to be hidden where there's only supposed to be cables. Since it's not supposed to be visible, it's also designed to easily attach an external button.

#### Flashing
For flashing the Sonoff Basic, hold the button while connecting the 3.3V power. The LED remains off until the flashing process is done and the board is rebooted.
For more information read instruction from [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-Basic/#serial-flashing) carefully.
